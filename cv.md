### About me

---

I started learning programming with Python, then became interested in Frontend development. I devote all my free time to learning, as I really love it. I can concentrate on the task, find solutions to the problems that have arisen, interact with people to get or convey the necessary information. My goal is to become a confident and professional Frontend developer.

Pete likes to bake some cakes. He has some recipes and ingredients. Unfortunately he is not good in maths. Can you help him to find out, how many cakes he could bake considering his recipes?

Write a function cakes(), which takes the recipe (object) and the available ingredients (also an object) and returns the maximum number of cakes Pete can bake (integer). For simplicity there are no units for the amounts (e.g. 1 lb of flour or 200 g of sugar are simply 1 or 200). Ingredients that are not present in the objects, can be considered as 0.

**Pytnon** example:
```
def cakes(recipie: dict, avaliable: dict) -> int:
    cakes_amount = []
    for product in recipie:
        if product in avaliable:
            cakes_amount.append(avaliable[product] // recipie[product])
        else:
            return 0
    return min(cakes_amount)
```
